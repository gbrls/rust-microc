# rust-microc
This is a WIP compiler for microc (a small C dialect). Written for learning purposes only.
## Dependencies
To run a compiled version of the compiler you'll need `gcc` and `nasm`.  
To use the project from sources you'll need the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and the above dependencies.
